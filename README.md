# Turing_Machine

Assignment from class

This is a simple implementation of a Turing Machine.

## Overview

A Turing Machine is a theoretical mathematical model of computation introduced by Alan Turing in 1936. It consists of an infinite tape divided into cells, a read/write head that moves left or right along the tape, and a finite set of states. The machine reads the symbol under the head, writes a new symbol, changes its state, and moves the head left or right based on a set of transition rules.

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository.

2. Run the Turing Machine by executing the ex program.

## Features

- Simple and minimalistic Turing Machine implementation.
- Easy to modify and experiment with the Turing Machine's behavior.
- Educational tool for understanding the fundamentals of computation.
